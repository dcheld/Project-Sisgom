         * files to the "propertiesFiles" list:

         * propertiesFiles.add(prefix + pluginName + packagePath + fileName);
         * 
         * With this mechanism, you can load properties files from your plugin or from another plugin.
         * 
         * You may want to load properties files from the file system, for that you need to add the absolute path of the file:
         * 
         * propertiesFiles.add("C:\Users\MyName\MyFile.properties");
         * 
         * If you want to let your users add properties files located in the same folder as the model:
         *
         * if (EMFPlugin.IS_ECLIPSE_RUNNING && model != null && model.eResource() != null) { 
         *     propertiesFiles.addAll(AcceleoEngineUtils.getPropertiesFilesNearModel(model.eResource()));
         * }

         * To register a package properly, please follow the following conventions:
         *
         * If the package is located in another plug-in, already installed in Eclipse. The following content should
         * have been generated at the beginning of this method. Do not register the package using this mechanism if
         * the metamodel is located in the workspace.
         *  
         * if (!isInWorkspace(UMLPackage.class)) {
         *     // The normal package registration if your metamodel is in a plugin.
         *     resourceSet.getPackageRegistry().put(UMLPackage.eNS_URI, UMLPackage.eINSTANCE);
         * }
         * 
         * If the package is located in another project in your workspace, the plugin containing the package has not
         * been register by EMF and Acceleo should register it automatically. If you want to use the generator in
         * stand alone, the regular registration (seen a couple lines before) is needed.
         * 
         * To learn more about Package Registration, have a look at the Acceleo documentation (Help -> Help Contents).
